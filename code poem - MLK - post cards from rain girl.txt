*dark_underbelly_of_the_world_wide_web.txt

this poem is about original sin:

ssh eden
cd garden
ls -l
cat adam.exe | grep "a soul" 
./adam.exe | eve.exe
rm -f adam.exe
git commit -m " u rde r"
exit


this poem is about not getting asked to prom:

zip(["boy_1", "boy_2", "boy_3"], ["girl_1", "girl_2", "boy_4", "me"])


this poem is about the end of the universe:

sudo su god
rm -rf *


this poem started life from a smaller poem, written by a friend who was cold (hands, shallow shoal heart):

#i say distant memories are meant to last but
#if i remember you, and you don't remember me, did it happen at all?

me = defaultdict(3)
me["you"] = int('inf')

def sweetOn(you):
  for _ in range(me[you]):
    yield "love"

f = sweetOn("you")
>>>f.next()
'love'
>>>f.next()
'love'
>>>f.next()
'love'
>>>
