# how-to-submit

This project is open to submissions C:<br />

Make a PR with poetry written in code or a (very) small computer system that is both functional + whose code has a semantically poetic double meaning<br />
I value the beauty/awe/poetic gut feeling over NLP tricks<br />
Title the PR with your favorite handle and optionally your given name<br />
Solicitations/advertisements are not allowed<br />
Unlikely, but I may post a link to this repo on forums or Medium, in which case I promise on my integrity I won't use or reshare your work as my own or for self-aggrandizement<br />
If you would like to submit the work to another zine, be aware of their rules on self-publishing before submitting here<br />
Also ping me if they actually understand or accept the work so I can submit too, never encountered a venue like that before<br />


No pressure, enjoy!
