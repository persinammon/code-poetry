# how-to-submit

This project is open to submissions C:
Make a PR with poetry written in code or a (very) small computer system that is both functional + whose code has a semantically poetic double meaning 
I value the beauty/awe/poetic gut feeling over NLP tricks
Title the PR with your favorite handle and optionally your given name
Solicitations/advertisements are not allowed
Unlikely, but I may post a link to this repo on forums or Medium, in which case I promise on my integrity I won't use or reshare your work as my own or for self-aggrandizement
If you would like to submit the work to another zine, be aware of their rules on self-publishing before submitting here
Also ping me if they actually understand or accept the work so I can submit too, never encountered a venue like that before


No pressure, enjoy!
