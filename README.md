# Code Poetry

This is a for fun project, similar to the personal site project repo on this profile page.
It is a set of poetry written in programming languages such as Python and Bash.

## Code Poem

The anatomy of a code poem:
- Written all in a programming language
- About a topic related to the human experience and using paradigms from programming
- No requirement to have an input or output
- No utility apart from hopefully a sense of beauty or emotional appeal (if it is a good poem)

## Extensions

This repo is open to PR's, outside contribution, or solicitation for submission to zines 
(if there's a computer x art zine for a semi-technical audience out there).

I was inspired by playing this video game growing up: [Digital: A Love Story](https://www.giantbomb.com/digital-a-love-story/3030-33066/) \
and the nostalgia of growing up with the Internet through the early 2000's.
