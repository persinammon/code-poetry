*dark_underbelly_of_the_world_wide_web.txt

this poem is about original sin:

ssh eden
cd garden
ls -l
cat adam.exe | grep "a soul" 
./adam.exe | eve.exe
rm -f adam.exe
git commit -m " u rde r"
exit


this poem is about not getting asked to prom:

zip(["boy_1", "boy_2", "boy_3"], ["girl_1", "girl_2", "boy_4", "me"])


this poem is about the end of the universe:

sudo su god
rm -rf *


this poem started life from a smaller poem, written by a friend who was cold (hands, shallow shoal heart):

#i say distant memories are meant to last but
#if i remember you, and you don't remember me, did it happen at all?

me = defaultdict(3)
me["you"] = int('inf')

def sweetOn(you):
  for _ in range(me[you]):
    yield "love"

f = sweetOn("you")
>>>f.next()
'love'
>>>f.next()
'love'
>>>f.next()
'love'
>>>

this poem is 5 centimeters per second and it's inspired by growing apart from puppy love:

byte same = (byte) 0b0110101; \\number
byte not_same = (byte) 0b0110101; \\number too

public static boolean weOrYouAndI(byte one, byte two) {
  
}

----------in progress------------

this poem is after the afterparty:

byte romeo = (byte) 0b00101010 == (int) 42; 
byte juliet = (byte) 0b00011101 == (int) 29; 


\\taking a bit out to make a new byte
byte lovable_experiment = romeo | juliet = 0b00111111 == (int) 63; 


/* this kid is energetic! odd prime, like you!
   no- 2*2*7->3*3*7, like you! 
   wow, you're right- you always were the smart one, honey! */


\\taking a byte out to make a bit of bytes
byte golden_child = romeo & juliet = 0b00001000 == (int) 8; 


/* we're so lucky, shy but studious. 
do 8's factor in your side of the family?
no, not really. 
i thought she'd be just like us.
she's just like us, and nothing like us at the same time? 
her great grandpa was a single digit too - 0b00000001 */


\\hey, let's not byte off more than we can chew
\\i concur, 2^1 is exhausting without a multiprocessing unit- a new server farm is opening in hawaii next year, should we transit?
\\aww that sounds like a great idea...but.......why are we still in single-line comments?..........oh no.
byte we_love_surprises = romeo ^ juliet = 0b00110111 == (int) 55; \\wild child


/* ......
....
.........
....
........ */

/* oops */


\\.... .... . .
\\you know, i always had a thing for family trees. 2^2?
\\........mom was right about men who are too even
